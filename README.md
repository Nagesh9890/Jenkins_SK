Example: If you want to process 15 GB of data in 5 seconds, and the processing speed is 3 GB/s,

CPU Cores = 15 GB / (5 seconds / 1 GB) = 15 GB / 5 GB/s = 3 CPU cores

if your processing task can handle 3 GB/s on a single CPU core, you would need at least 3 CPU cores to process 15 GB of data in 5 seconds.

RAM Requirements Formula:

RAM Required = Data Size + Buffer for OS and Processes

Example: If you want to process 15 GB of data, consider adding some buffer for the operating system and other processes, let's say 2 GB,

RAM Required = 15 GB + 2 GB = 17 GB
